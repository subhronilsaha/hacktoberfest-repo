# Hacktoberfest Repository for Algorithms

<strong><ins> NOTE:</ins> Hacktoberfest 2020 has concluded! Congratulations for everyone who participated this year! This repository is now closed. </strong>

This is a repository for people to get accustomed to making open-source contributions, aligning with the spirit of Hacktoberfest. I will be contributing Data Structures and Algorithm problem solutions here, and would encourage the others to do the same. The focus should be on learning algorithms and not just copy pasting solutions from the internet. 

### What is Hacktoberfest?

Hacktoberfest is basically a celebration of open-source and its community sponsored by DigitalOcean that happens every October. People are encouraged to submit pull requests and make more open source contributions. You need to make 4 successful pull requests within 31st October to be eligible to win a Hacktoberfest tee. (Only for the first 70,000 participants worldwide). Register here: https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com

### How to Contribute?

- Fork this repo by clicking on the Fork button on top right.

- Clone the repo to your system.

  cd hacktoberfest-repo
  ```
- Make a new branch. Paste the below code snippet in your terminal. (Remove '<' and '>')
  
  ```
  git checkout -b <your-algorithm-name>
  ```
  
- Add a new algorithm in a separate folder. See contribution guidelines for more info.

- After making changes, push the code to your branch.
  
  ```
  git add .
  git commit -m "message"
  git push origin <your-branch-name>
  ```
- Go to your branch and click on 'Compare and Pull Request' button. Add a description of the algorithm also.
  
### Contribution Guidelines:

- Commit message will be of format ```"Adding/modifying <algorithm-name>"```
- Do not push changes to master directly.
- Name the folder with the Algorithm's name. 
- Algorithms can be written in any language. It could be a Leetcode question, or a question from competitive programming contests.
- Please avoid adding algorithms already added by others.
  
### Happy Hacking!
