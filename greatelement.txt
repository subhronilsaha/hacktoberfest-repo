Next Greater Element
Last Updated: 24-07-2019
Given an array, print the Next Greater Element (NGE) for every element. The Next greater Element for an element x is the first greater element on the right side of x in array. Elements for which no greater element exist, consider next greater element as -1.

Examples:

For any array, rightmost element always has next greater element as -1.
For an array which is sorted in decreasing order, all elements have next greater element as -1.
For the input array [4, 5, 2, 25}, the next greater elements for each element are as follows.
Element       NGE
   4      -->   5
   5      -->   25
   2      -->   25
   25     -->   -1
d) For the input array [13, 7, 6, 12}, the next greater elements for each element are as follows.

  Element        NGE
   13      -->    -1
   7       -->     12
   6       -->     12
   12      -->     -1
Recommended: Please solve it on “PRACTICE ” first, before moving on to the solution.
Method 1 (Simple)
Use two loops: The outer loop picks all the elements one by one. The inner loop looks for the first greater element for the element picked by the outer loop. If a greater element is found then that element is printed as next, otherwise -1 is printed.
