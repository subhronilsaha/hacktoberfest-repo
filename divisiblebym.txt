Count the numbers divisible by ‘M’ in a given range
Last Updated: 18-07-2019
A and B are two numbers which define a range, where A <= B. Find the total numbers in the given range [A … B] divisible by 'M'

Examples:

Input  : A = 25, B = 100, M = 30
Output : 3
Explanation : In the given range [25 - 100], 
30, 60 and 90 are divisible by 30

Input : A = 6, B = 15, M = 3
Output : 4
Explanation : In the given range [6 - 15],
6, 9, 12 and 15 are divisible by 3
Recommended: Please solve it on “PRACTICE” first, before moving on to the solution.
Method 1 : [Brute-force]
Run a loop from A to B. If a number divisible by ‘M’ is found, increment counter.

Below is the implementation of above method:

    int counter = 0; 
  
    // Running a loop from A to B and check 
    // if a number is divisible by M. 
    for (int i = A; i <= B; i++) 
        if (i % M == 0) 
            counter++; 
  
    return counter; 
} 
  
// Driver code 
int main() 
{ 
    // A and B define the range, M is the dividend 
    int A = 30, B = 100, M = 30; 
  
    // Printing the result 
    cout << countDivisibles(A, B, M) << endl; 
  
    return 0;
